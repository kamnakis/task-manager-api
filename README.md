# task-manager-api

This is the REST API of a task manager app.<br/>
I used express to handle the http requests.<br/>
I used mongodb and mongoose for the database.<br/>
I used modules like JWT, multer, sharp, validator for generating tokens, uploading and editing pictures and validating data.<br/>
I used sendgrid mail to send mails.<br/>
I used bcryptjs to encrypt sensitive data.<br/>
<br/>
I made this following this node js course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/<br/>
