# task-manager-api

This is the REST API of a task manager app.
I used express to handle the http requests.
I used mongodb and mongoose for the database.
I used modules like JWT, multer, sharp, validator for generating tokens, uploading and editing pictures and validating data.
I used sendgrid mail to send mails.
I used bcryptjs to encrypt sensitive data.

I made this following this node js course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/
